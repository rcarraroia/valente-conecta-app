# How to Test Features in Sandbox

Introduction

Although it works very similarly to the production environment, some features need to be tested in a specific way.

On the following pages, you will find detailed instructions on how to test each of these features in the sandbox:

*   [How to make transfers.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-make-transfers)
*   [Testing Bill Payment](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/testing-bill-payment)
*   [How to test credit card payment.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-test-credit-card-payment)
*   [How to test a payment via QR Code.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-test-a-payment-via-qr-code)
*   [How to test critical actions.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-test-critical-actions)
*   [Trying to pay Pix QR Code in Sandbox without a registered key = 404 error.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/trying-to-pay-pix-qr-code-in-sandbox-without-a-registered-key-404-error)
*   [How to generate new charges from a subscription.](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-generate-new-charges-from-a-subscription)

You can also check which features can be tested in our sandbox here.

In addition, you can use our documentation to make calls directly in the sandbox environment. See how to do this here: How to test calls [in the documentation](https://docs.asaas.com/docs/how-to-test-api-calls-in-our-documentation).
